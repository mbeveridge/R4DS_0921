# MOOC : "R for Data Science"
###### 14/10/21 - xx/x/xx

Re-reading “[**R for Data Science**](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)” by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham. (Previously bought it for Jesse Maegan's MOOC in [R4DS_0917](https://github.com/mbeveridge/R4DS_0917) and reread it in [R4DS_1217](https://github.com/mbeveridge/R4DS_1217). But the [online version](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) [[repo](https://github.com/hadley/r4ds)] has had some updates since then (including xxx). A new hardcopy version is due [~2022](https://twitter.com/mbeveridge/status/1352299801048731652), which will exclude `modelr` in favour of learning `tidymodels` elsewhere ...perhaps at "[Tidy Modeling with R](https://www.tmwr.org/)")

Files in this repo contain my answers from attempting Exercises in the book, but there may still be notes from 2017 giving credit to others.
